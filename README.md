It is proposed that the election commission modify the current script for use with any election.  Current script can be modified by initiating the following code changes:


1.  


2.  Consolidate the print commands for candidates and counties into 1 statement.  Current code has print commands for county and candidate data within 3 separate lines of code creating a consolidated output in the Election_Analysis text file
